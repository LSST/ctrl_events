These simple examples show how to use the event system in Python:

doit - shell script to run transmit.py after a 10 second delay
transmit_1.py - transmits an event to receive_1
receive_1.py - blocking receive with timeout

transmit_2.py - transmits an event to receive_2
receive_2.py - blocking receive

For the first three examples, run the activemq message broker.  You'll 
need to change the example code's constructors to point at the machine 
where you are running it, if you don't use the broker on lsst8.

EventSystemTransmit_1.py - transmits an event to EventSystemRecv_1
EventSystemRecv_1.py - blocking receive

EventSystemTransmit_2.py - transmits an event to EventSystemRecv_2
EventSystemRecv_2.py - blocking receive with timeout

If I'm running in one window, I generally run:

$ ./doit &
$ python receive_1.py

and wait for the results.   This runs the "doit" shell script in the background
and waits for 10 seconds before transmitting an event.

Doing the following:


$ ./doit &
$ python receive_2.py

will produce similar results as the first example.  You can also run it
like:

$ python receive_1.py

without the transmit.  The receive will timeout.
